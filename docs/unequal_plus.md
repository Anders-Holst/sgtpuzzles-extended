### Unequal+
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SteffenBauer/sgtpuzzles-extended/master/screenshots/unequal_plus.png)

Contains a new puzzle variation: *Kropki*, implementation of [Kropki](http://wiki.logic-masters.de/index.php?title=Kropki/de)

Works similiar to the *Adjacent* mode, with these rules:

* A black circle indicates that one number is double to its neighbour.
* A white circle indicates that one number is adjacent (one higher / lower) to its neighbour.
* No circle means both numbers must not be double or adjacent.
* The numbers *1* and *2* are both double and adjacent to each other. In this case, the circle color is chosen randomly.
