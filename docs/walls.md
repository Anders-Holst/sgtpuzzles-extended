### Walls

*Status*: Nearly finished; only path dragging is missing.

This is an implementation of the excellent puzzle *Alcazar*, which I found in the Android store quite some time ago. Unfortunately, the developers of it don't seem to have time to maintain it anymore and pulled it from the Android store.

Objective of this game is to find a path through the given maze of walls, following these rules:

* The path enters the grid from one open border, and leaves the grid through another open border.
* All grid cells are visited once.
* The path may not cross itself or form loops.
* The path cannot go through a wall.

Controls:

* Left-click on a border between two cells to place a path segment.
* Right-click on a border between two cells to place a wall.
