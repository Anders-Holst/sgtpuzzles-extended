Extensions/Modifications I wrote for the famous & excellent [Simon Tathams Portable Puzzle Collection](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/)

## Extensions:

* Solo: Additional keyboard controls to support game solving and 
    * Pressing '+' automatically sets all possible game clues
    * Pressing '-' removes all impossible game clues
    * Pressing a number while no grid cell is selected highlights all grid cells with that number. Left/Right click on a clue in this highlight mode sets the number / removes the clue.
* Slant:
    * Extended the generator to three difficulty levels "Easy", "Tricky", "Hard"
    * New puzzle variation: "Creek", implementation of [Creek](http://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Creek/index.htm)
* Undead:
    * More sophisticated puzzle generator
    * Four difficulty levels "Easy", "Normal", "Tricky", "Hard"
    * New option "Remove clues", similiar to the option in the 'Magnets' puzzle
* Unequal:
    * New puzzle variation: "Kropki", implementation of [Kropki](http://wiki.logic-masters.de/index.php?title=Kropki/de)
* Unfinished/Stellar: New puzzle "Stellar", implementation of [Sternenhaufen](http://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Sternenhaufen/index.htm)
    * So far playable in difficulty "Normal".
